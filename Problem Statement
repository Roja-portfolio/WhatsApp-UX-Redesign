# Problem Statement

WhatsApp is one of the most widely used messaging applications globally. Despite its popularity, there are several usability and accessibility gaps that can be improved to deliver a more intuitive experience:

- Cluttered chat input area with multiple buttons.
- Lack of clear online presence indicators.
- Limited media-first focus inside friend profile.
- Navigational complexity inside settings.
- Unnecessary home screen camera icon.
