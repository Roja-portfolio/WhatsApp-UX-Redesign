This document explains the rationale behind key design changes made during the redesign of WhatsApp as part of the personal UX case study project.

## 🏠 Home Page

### 🔧 Problems Identified:
- The camera icon on the home page was rarely used by most users.
- Users had to open individual chats to check if someone was online.
- Viewing active statuses required navigating to the status tab.

### 💡 Design Solutions:
- Removed the home screen camera icon to simplify the UI and reclaim space.
- Introduced an online status bubble overlay directly on the user's display picture (DP), inspired by Telegram and earlier Instagram versions.
- Added a green circular ring indicator around DPs of users who have active statuses for quick scanning.

## 💬 Chat Page

### 🔧 Problems Identified:
- Current UI contains too many buttons cluttering the message input field (emoji, stickers, voice, attachments, etc.)
- Complex layout affects one-handed usage and accessibility.

### 💡 Design Solutions:
- Simplified the input field by consolidating emoji, message, voice, and document functions into a cleaner layout.
- Removed redundant emoji button. Fun characters remain accessible through the system emoji keyboard.
- Reduced button clutter to improve accessibility for one-handed or limited-mobility users.

## ⚙️ Settings Page

### 🔧 Problems Identified:
- Users easily get lost in deep settings navigation.
- Navigating back to the home screen feels unintuitive.

### 💡 Design Solutions:
- Introduced a partial ¾ overlay design for the settings page to maintain context and spatial orientation.
- Enabled persistent navigation visibility to make exiting settings easy from any subpage.
- Simplified navigation structure to minimize disorientation.

## 👤 Friend’s Profile Page

### 🔧 Problems Identified:
- Media and document access was buried under chat information.
- Visual design felt basic and lacked personality.

### 💡 Design Solutions:
- Introduced a large header banner behind profile DPs for visual appeal (inspired by LinkedIn).
- Moved the DP to the left side to create a more spacious, modern feel.
- Prioritized media, docs, and links at the top of the profile page for faster access.
- Moved chat settings to a separate subpage as they are used less frequently.
