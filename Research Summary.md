# Research Summary

I conducted a light user survey with a small sample to understand WhatsApp usage behaviors. Key insights:

- Most users do not use the home page camera feature.
- Users struggle to identify online presence quickly.
- People often visit friend profiles mainly to access shared media rather than chat settings.
- Users get lost inside deep settings navigation.

I also referenced competitor apps like Telegram, Signal, LinkedIn, and Instagram to inform design inspiration.
