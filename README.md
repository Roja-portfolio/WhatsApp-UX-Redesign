# WhatsApp UX Redesign — Case Study 📱

This repository contains my personal UX case study where I redesigned WhatsApp to improve usability, accessibility, and user experience — while maintaining the app's core brand identity and familiarity.

Redesign WhatsApp to address:

- Cluttered chat input interface
